\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the TEACHme application in terms of usability, conversational feedback relevance, and overall user experience. The study aimed to identify strengths and areas for improvement in order to refine the application.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participants}
The pilot study included four participants selected to represent a diverse range of demographics and technical proficiencies. The participants varied in age and included both male and female genders. Occupations among the participants included a bank intern, students, and a physical education teacher in a primary school. Technical proficiency levels ranged from moderately proficient to very proficient, ensuring a broad spectrum of user experiences with the TEACHme application. A detailed description of each participant, including specific characteristics, will be illustrated in a later section.

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants signed up, logged in, and were assigned to three different conversation scenarios. Feedback was collected after each conversation, focusing on conversation feedback relevance, pronunciation and synonym suggestions, difficulty level, and general usability.
\\\\
Each participant had the following conversations with the related difficulty levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: medium)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: hard)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 2:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: medium)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 3:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: medium)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 4:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: medium)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: easy)
    \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Participant 5:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: medium)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: easy)

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The duration was set to 5 minutes for each conversation.

\section{Data Collection}

\subsection{Demographic Data}
The participants' demographic information was collected to provide context for their feedback.

\subsection{Usability Feedback}
Participants were asked to rate the ease of navigation, report any issues or bugs, and provide overall usability feedback.

\subsection{Conversational Feedback}
Participants' responses were collected on the relevance of the conversation feedback and the accuracy of pronunciation/synonym suggestions.

\subsection{Difficulty Levels}
Participants were asked to assign difficulty levels to each conversation (easy, medium, hard).

\subsection{Naturalness of Conversations}
Participants provided feedback on whether conversations felt natural and human-like.
