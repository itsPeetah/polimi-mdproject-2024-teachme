\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the TEACHme application in terms of usability, conversational feedback relevance, and overall user experience. The study aimed to identify strengths and areas for improvement in order to refine the application.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participants}
The pilot study included four participants selected to represent a diverse range of demographics and technical proficiencies. The participants varied in age and included both male and female genders. Occupations among the participants included a bank intern, students, and a physical education teacher in a primary school. Technical proficiency levels ranged from moderately proficient to very proficient, ensuring a broad spectrum of user experiences with the TEACHme application. A detailed description of each participant, including specific characteristics, will be illustrated in a later section.

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants signed up, logged in, and were assigned to three different conversation scenarios. Feedback was collected after each conversation, focusing on conversation feedback relevance, pronunciation and synonym suggestions, difficulty level, and general usability.
\\\\
Each participant had the following conversations with the related difficulty levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: medium)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: hard)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 2:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: medium)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 3:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: easy)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: medium)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 4:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conversation 1: Last summer holidays (Difficulty: medium)
        \item Conversation 2: Hobbies (Difficulty: hard)
        \item Conversation 3: Favorite food (Difficulty: easy)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The duration was set to 5 minutes for each conversation.

\section{Data Collection}

\subsection{Demographic Data}
The participants' demographic information was collected to provide context for their feedback.

\subsection{Usability Feedback}
Participants were asked to rate the ease of navigation, report any issues or bugs, and provide overall usability feedback.

\subsection{Conversational Feedback}
Participants' responses were collected on the relevance of the conversation feedback and the accuracy of pronunciation/synonym suggestions.

\subsection{Difficulty Levels}
Participants were asked to assign difficulty levels to each conversation (easy, medium, hard).

\subsection{Naturalness of Conversations}
Participants provided feedback on whether conversations felt natural and human-like.

        \item The conversation was mostly human-like, but safety principles were too strict, and some answers felt empty.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 4:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The conversation felt quite natural. However, the participant sometimes preferred shorter replies from the agent.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Comments and Suggestions for Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participant 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overall, the participant liked the application and suggested adding functionalities for self-study, improving UI clarity, and making the agent's responses more natural.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}
The TEACHme application showed promise in usability and engaging conversations but required minor improvements in UI clarity, natural conversation integration, and functionalities for self-study.

\subsection{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve UI clarity by adding instructions or on-hover descriptions.
    \item Address minor bugs, such as interruptions during conversation and delayed feedback visibility.
    \item Enhance the naturalness of conversations by integrating personal thoughts and experiences into the agent's responses.
    \item Add functionalities for self-study to allow students to practice independently.
    \item Adjust the time the agent waits while the user is thinking to allow for longer thinking times.
